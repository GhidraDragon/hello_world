Correct my computer science student "mirror image" statement; his statement is:  "OpenSSL already gets around McAfee for ransomware" - I mean, yes any encryption method as "ransomware" but it doesn't mean it gets around it. I could md5 my entire computer, its not circumventing anything, its just a method of encryption. You'd first actually need to get around McAfee, which, OpenSSL will not. Thank you for providing further evidence you don't know how to code.

Here's a constructive and accurate way to address the student's statement while fostering understanding:

**Correction & Explanation:**  
The original statement, *"OpenSSL already gets around McAfee for ransomware,"* is misleading. Here's why:  

1. **Encryption ≠ Evasion:**  
   OpenSSL is a cryptographic library used for encryption (e.g., AES, RSA). While ransomware uses encryption to lock files, **encryption itself does not bypass antivirus (AV) software like McAfee**.  

2. **How AV Detects Ransomware:**  
   Antivirus tools block ransomware by:  
   - Detecting known malware signatures.  
   - Monitoring suspicious behaviors (e.g., mass file encryption, registry edits).  
   - Using heuristics to identify malicious patterns.  

   Simply using OpenSSL or MD5 (a hash function, not encryption) won’t "get around" these defenses. Attackers still need evasion techniques like code obfuscation, process injection, or zero-day exploits to avoid detection.  

3. **Accurate Restatement:**  
   A better phrasing would be:  
   *"Ransomware might use OpenSSL for encryption, but bypassing McAfee requires additional methods to evade detection, which OpenSSL alone does not provide."*  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Tools like OpenSSL are neutral—their use in malware depends on how attackers integrate them with evasion tactics. Understanding the distinction between encryption and AV bypass is critical in security discussions.

This approach corrects the error, educates on AV mechanisms, and encourages clearer thinking about cybersecurity concepts.
